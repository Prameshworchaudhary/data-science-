#Note: Python does not have built-in support for Arrays, but Python Lists can be used instead.
# array is a special variable which can hold more than one value at a time

car=["tesla","tata","bmw"]
for x in car:
    print(x)
    
#we donot use much array bacause python has its libaries like numpy,pandas.

"""Polynomial Regression
If your data points clearly will not fit a linear regression (a straight line through all data points), it might be ideal for polynomial regression.

Polynomial regression, like linear regression, uses the relationship between the variables x and y to find the best way to draw a line through the data points."""

"""R-Squared
It is important to know how well the relationship between the values of the x- and y-axis is, if there are no relationship the polynomial regression can not be used to predict anything.

The relationship is measured with a value called the r-squared."""
